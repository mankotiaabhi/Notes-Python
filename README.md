## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Dictionary and Set use hashing (fast lookup).
- List is dynamic array (fast access, slower middle insert).
- String is immutable.
- Functions improve modularity.
- OOP helps organize code structure.

## 🚀 How To Use These Notes

- Read theory part first.
- Run the code examples separately in `.py` files.
- Practice modifying the examples.
- Revise time complexity regularly.
